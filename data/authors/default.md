Passionate software developer.
Though I do not have a programming background, I started learning web development in the summer of 2019.
Besides this, in my spare time I focus on preparing myself for cycling races (MTB Cross-Country, Ciclo-Cross, Road-Races).

The purpose of this blog is to encourage others that it is never to late to start a new thing, as long as you are fond of it.
