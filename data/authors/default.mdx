I am a passionate software developer who began learning web development in the summer of 2019, despite not having a formal programming background. In addition to my software development journey, I have extensive experience with Power BI, Office, Excel, and VBA, and I have also completed various extra work projects in these areas.

What most attracts me to software development and IT is the feeling of craftsmanship: the satisfaction of creating something elegant and functional from scratch. I love learning and continually seek to expand my knowledge and skills.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I dedicate my spare time to preparing for cycling races, including MTB Cross-Country, Cyclo-Cross, and Road Races.

The purpose of this blog is to inspire others by demonstrating that it's never too late to start something new, as long as you are passionate about it.
